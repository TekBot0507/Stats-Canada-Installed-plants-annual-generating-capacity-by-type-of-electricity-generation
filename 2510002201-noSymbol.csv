Footnotes:
1,"Beginning in 2015, a large number of renewable energy companies engaged in solar, wind, hydro and other renewable technologies were added to the survey's overall target population. As a result, the number of establishments surveyed increased from 400 to 1200 establishments. Consequently, users should use caution when making historical comparisons with the data prior to 2015."
2,"The capacity measured at the output terminals of all generating units in a station, without deducting station service requirements."
3,"Electric power generated from a plant in which the turbine generators are driven by flowing water."
4,"A power plant in which the prime mover is a wind turbine. Electric power is generated by the conversion of wind power into mechanical energy."
5,"Electricity created by using Photovoltaic (PV) technology by converting solar energy into solar electricity from sunlight."
6,"A power plant in which the prime mover is a steam turbine. The steam used to drive the turbine is produced in a boiler where fossil fuels or other combustible materials are burned."
7,"Electricity generated at an electric power plant whose turbines are driven by steam generated in a reactor by heat from the fission of nuclear fuel."
8,"A power plant in which the prime mover is a combustion turbine. Electric power is generated by the burning of a fuel into mechanical energy."
9,"A power plant in which the prime mover is an internal combustion turbine. Electric power is generated by the rapid burning of a fuel-air mixture into mechanical energy."
